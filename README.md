# FCC Quotes Machine

The FCC Quotes Machine project is a web application that generates random quotes and allows users to share them on social media. It was developed as a part of the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) curriculum and serves as a practical exercise in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Random Quote Generation: The application fetches quotes from an external API and displays them randomly each time the page is loaded or the "New Quote" button is clicked.
- Share on Social Media: Users can share their favorite quotes on Twitter by clicking the "Tweet" button, which opens a Twitter share dialog with the selected quote pre-populated.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the user interface and making it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: Used for fetching quotes from the API, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the page.
